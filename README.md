a. An introduction to the app.
==============================
This program is written in python. It allows basic arithmatic of both decimal and whole numbers.
It also allows conversion between different units.

Instructions to download and run:
1. Install python3
2. Download the zip file
3. Unzip the file
4. To run the file on windows, open the location of the file in windows explorer and double click on main.py

==============================

b. List the requirements you have managed to implement.
==============================
MUST:
As a user I want the calculator application hosted on GitHub in a public repository
so that anyone can access the application and has clear instructions on how to
download and run the calculator in the form of a readme.

As a developer I want the application written in a popular language such as
Python3 (https://python.org/downloads/) or as a simple webpage written in
JavaScript and html so that anyone can easily extend the application in the future.

As a user I want to be able to compute basic Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
and Division sums so that I can use the calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

As a user I need a user interface be it graphical or console based so that I can
clearly see my mathematical inputs and the result.

SHOULD:
As a user I want to be able to work with both whole numbers and decimal
numbers so that the calculator allows for more versatile input and output.

# As a user I care about the accuracy and code quality, as such I need tests to prove
that Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division sums work as expected.

As a user I would like to be able to convert between the following units:
- Kilos to Stone
- Gigabytes to bytes
- Inches to Centimetres
- Days to Seconds

COULD
# As a user I would like to use the application for Programmatic operation so that I
can convert between Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal.

# As a user I would like to use the calculator for more advanced arithmetic
operations so that I can chain simple equations together such as (100+26)/6.
